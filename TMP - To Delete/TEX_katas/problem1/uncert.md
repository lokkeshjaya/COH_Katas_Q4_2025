#### Ensure Multi-Provider Flexibility
While a primary LLM provider (e.g., Azure OpenAI) powers the Generative AI engine, design the system to support failover to alternatives (e.g., Google AI, Cohere).
- Use an AI Gateway or feature flag system to route requests based on provider health.
- Maintain provider-agnostic prompt templates for seamless switching.

#### Optimize Prompt Engineering
Reduce cost and latency by refining prompt design:
- Keep prompts focused on rebalancing logic and operational instructions.
- Use a RAG system to inject contextual data (fleet status, demand hotspots, traffic).
- Cache frequently used context to avoid redundant calls.

#### Match Model to Task Complexity
Not all tasks require high-end models:
- Use smaller models for simple notifications or status updates.
- Reserve advanced models for generating rebalancing strategies and scenario simulations.

#### Incident Response Planning
Prepare for failure scenarios:
- **Outage**: Switch to backup provider via AI Gateway.
- **Cost surge**: Implement caps and fallback to smaller models.
- **Model drift**: Rollback to last validated version.
- Define communication protocols for operations and support teams.
- Maintain manual override capability for critical rebalancing decisions.
