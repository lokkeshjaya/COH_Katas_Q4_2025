### adr.md â€“ Architecture Decision Record for Vehicle Demand Forecasting and Rebalancing

#### Title
Integration of Predictive Analytics and Generative AI for Vehicle Rebalancing

#### Status
Proposed

#### Context
Mobility Corp faces challenges in ensuring vehicle availability at the right locations and times. Customers often report unavailability, leading to poor user experience and operational inefficiencies. A proactive system is needed to forecast demand, rebalance vehicles dynamically, and communicate effectively with field teams and customers.

The solution must:
- Forecast demand using historical and real-time data (e.g., weather, user behavior).
- Generate rebalancing strategies using optimization algorithms.
- Deliver actionable insights to operations teams and personalized responses to customers.
- Support scenario simulation for strategic planning.

#### Decision
We will implement a hybrid AI-powered system combining predictive analytics, Generative AI, and optimization logic. Key components include:
- Data ingestion layer to collect real-time data from user apps and IoT devices.
- Feature store to prepare data for machine learning models.
- Predictive model to forecast demand across geographies and time slots.
- Generative AI engine to convert predictions into natural language insights and operational instructions.
- Optimization engine to formulate rebalancing strategies based on constraints like fleet size, traffic, and availability.
- Dashboards and mobile apps for field teams to receive dynamic instructions.
- Customer experience AI to provide personalized updates and recommendations.
- Scenario simulator to test hypothetical changes and support strategic decisions.

#### Consequences

**Positive**
- Improved vehicle availability through proactive rebalancing.
- Enhanced customer satisfaction with timely and personalized updates.
- Operational efficiency via automated strategy generation and communication.
- Scalability to support growing fleet and geographic expansion.

**Negative**
- System complexity due to integration of multiple AI components.
- Vendor dependency for Generative AI services.
- Risk of inaccurate predictions requiring validation and override mechanisms.
- Initial investment in data infrastructure, AI models, and monitoring tools.
