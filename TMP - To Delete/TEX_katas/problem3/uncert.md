Implement a multi-provider strategy:  While Azure OpenAI was chosen, the architecture should be designed to easily failover to another LLM provider, such as Google AI or a specialized provider, in case of an outage. This can be managed through a feature flag system or an AI gateway that automatically routes requests based on provider health checks.


Optimize prompt design: Use prompt engineering techniques to reduce the number of tokens per request. This can include writing more concise prompts and leveraging a RAG system to provide context efficiently, rather than including large amounts of information in every call.

Choose the right model for the task: Not all LLM tasks require the most powerful and expensive model. For simpler tasks like text classification or sentiment analysis, use smaller, more cost-effective models to optimize expenses.

Develop a clear incident response plan: Create a protocol for handling different failure scenarios, such as a major outage, a significant price increase, or a decline in model quality. Define communication plans for stakeholders and have a rollback strategy in place.
