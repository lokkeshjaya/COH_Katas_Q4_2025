1. Title
    Integration of Gen AI for dynamic user milestone and ranking content. 
2. Status
     proposed
3. Context
       The existing user engagement strategy relies on static leaderboards and pre-defined milestones, which suffer from a lack of personalization and can lead to user disengagement. A more dynamic and personalized system is required to improve customer loyalty, retention, and overall engagement within the MobilityCorp application. The solution must provide unique, engaging content (e.g., personalized quest narratives, reward descriptions) and dynamic rankings based on real-time user behavior. 
4. Decision
We will implement a Gen AI-powered system to generate dynamic user milestones, personalized ranking narratives, and contextual rewards. The core components of this system will include: 
    . A microservice-based architecture to isolate the Gen AI-powered feature from the core MobilityCorp platform.
    . Integration with a third-party LLM (Large Language Model) provider, such as Cohere, Azure OpenAI, or Google AI.
    . A user profiling module that leverages machine learning to segment users based on their driving behavior and rental history.
    . A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to provide the Gen AI with up-to-date context, such as vehicle models, city-specific landmarks, and rental trends.
    . A dedicated content database to store generated milestones, preventing duplication and ensuring a consistent user experience. 
5. Consequences
Positive
    . Increased user engagement and loyalty: Personalized experiences will make the app more appealing and habit-forming for users, increasing retention and lifetime value.
    . Dynamic and personalized content: Moving away from static, one-size-fits-all content allows for a more personalized and compelling user journey.
    . Competitive differentiation: This innovative feature will distinguish the app from competitors who use traditional, rule-based systems.
    . Efficient content generation: The system can scale to create a near-infinite variety of personalized milestones and narrative elements without manual effort. 
Negative
    . Increased complexity: Introducing Gen AI adds new layers of complexity, including LLM integration, data pipelines, and prompt engineering, increasing maintenance overhead.
    . Dependency on external vendors: The system is dependent on the availability, pricing, and performance of third-party LLM providers.
    . Potential for unpredictable output: Gen AI can sometimes produce unexpected or irrelevant content. Robust filtering and moderation layers are required to maintain brand voice and quality.
    . Initial development cost: There will be a significant upfront cost for developing the Gen AI microservice, data integration, and monitoring infrastructure.
