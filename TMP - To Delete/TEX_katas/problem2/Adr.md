#### Title
Integration of Gen AI for Predictive Battery Swap Scheduling

#### Status
Proposed

#### Context
The current battery swap process for electric vehicles and scooters is reactive, relying on manual checks or static schedules. This leads to inefficiencies such as vehicles running out of charge, increased downtime, and poor customer experience. A proactive, data-driven approach is needed to optimize battery maintenance and ensure vehicle availability.

The solution must:
- Predict battery depletion based on historical usage and real-time telemetry.
- Generate dynamic, daily swap schedules tailored to fleet usage patterns.
- Reduce operational overhead while improving customer satisfaction.

#### Decision
We will implement a Gen AI-powered system to create predictive battery swap schedules and contextual maintenance alerts. The core components will include:
- **Microservice-based architecture** to isolate the Gen AI scheduling engine from the core MobilityCorp platform.
- **Integration with a third-party LLM provider** (e.g., Azure OpenAI, Cohere, Google AI) for generating human-readable schedules and notifications.
- **Telemetry-driven data pipeline** to collect real-time battery levels, location, and usage patterns.
- **Machine Learning prediction module** to forecast battery depletion and prioritize swaps.
- **RAG system** to provide Gen AI with contextual data such as fleet size, charging station availability, and traffic conditions.
- **Scheduling database** to store generated plans and ensure consistency across operations.

#### Consequences

**Positive**
- **Optimized fleet uptime:** Predictive scheduling minimizes downtime and improves vehicle availability.
- **Operational efficiency:** Reduces manual intervention and streamlines maintenance workflows.
- **Enhanced customer experience:** Fewer disruptions due to low battery incidents.
- **Scalable solution:** Can adapt to growing fleet sizes and diverse usage patterns.

**Negative**
- **Increased complexity:** Requires integration of telemetry, ML models, and Gen AI services.
- **Vendor dependency:** Relies on third-party LLM providers for schedule generation.
- **Unpredictable outputs:** Gen AI may produce impractical or unclear schedules; validation layers are needed.
- **Initial cost:** Significant investment in data infrastructure, AI models, and monitoring systems.
