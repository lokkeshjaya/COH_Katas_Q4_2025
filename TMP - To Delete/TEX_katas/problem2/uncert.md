### uncert.md â€“ Risk Mitigation and Best Practices for EV Scheduling

#### Implement a Multi-Provider Strategy
While Azure OpenAI (or chosen provider) powers the Gen AI model, design the architecture to easily failover to another LLM provider (e.g., Google AI, Cohere) in case of outages or performance degradation.
- Use an **AI Gateway** or **feature flag system** to route requests dynamically based on provider health checks.
- Maintain provider-agnostic prompt templates for quick switching.

#### Optimize Prompt Design
Reduce token usage and cost by applying prompt engineering techniques:
- Keep prompts concise and focused on scheduling logic.
- Use **RAG system** to inject contextual data (fleet size, station availability, traffic) instead of embedding large static details in every prompt.
- Cache frequently used context to minimize repeated calls.

#### Choose the Right Model for Each Task
Not all tasks require the most expensive LLM:
- Use smaller models for simple tasks like **status notifications** or **basic text formatting**.
- Reserve high-capacity models for complex scheduling scenarios involving multiple constraints.

#### Develop a Clear Incident Response Plan
Prepare for failure scenarios such as:
- **Major outage**: Switch to backup provider via AI Gateway.
- **Price surge**: Implement cost caps and fallback to smaller models.
- **Model quality drop**: Trigger rollback to last stable version.
- Define **communication protocols** for operations teams and stakeholders.
- Maintain **manual override capability** for critical scheduling during emergencies.
