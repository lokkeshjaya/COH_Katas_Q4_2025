# Project Overview
This repository contains solutions to three distinct problems. Each problem is organized into its own folder and includes:
- 📁 Architecture Diagram (`architecture.png`)
- 📄 Architecture Decision Record (`adr.md`)
- 📄 Uncertainty Documentation (`uncert.md`)
---
## Problem statement : MobilityCorp customers keep complaining that the right vehicles aren't in the right place
**Folder:** `problem1/`
**Contents:**
- `architecture.png`: Visual representation of the system architecture.
- `adr.md`: Decisions made during the design and implementation.
- `uncert.md`: Known uncertainties and assumptions.
---
## Problem statement : MobilityCorp also have problems with there electric vehicles running out of charge
**Folder:** `problem2/`
**Contents:**
- `architecture.png`: Visual representation of the system architecture.
- `adr.md`: Decisions made during the design and implementation.
- `uncert.md`: Known uncertainties and assumptions.
---
## Problem statement : MobilityCorp want there customers to use there services more frequently
**Folder:** `problem3/`
**Contents:**
- `architecture.png`: Visual representation of the system architecture.
- `adr.md`: Decisions made during the design and implementation.
- `uncert.md`: Known uncertainties and assumptions.

## How to Use
1. Navigate to the folder of the problem you're interested in.
2. Review the architecture diagram for a high-level understanding.
3. Read the `adr.md` to understand the rationale behind design choices.
4. Check `uncert.md` for any open questions or assumptions.
