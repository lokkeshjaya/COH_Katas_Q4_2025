| **Title** | Utilize a Reinforcement Learning Model for Swap/Charging Optimization |
| **Status** | Accepted |
| **Context** | The problem of prioritizing and routing staff for battery swaps/charging is a complex, multi-variable **optimization problem** (minimize travel time, maximize fleet uptime, incorporate future demand). Simple rule-based logic or traditional linear programming struggles with dynamic city traffic and demand changes. |
| **Decision** | Utilize a **Reinforcement Learning (RL) model** where the "agent" is the routing algorithm, and the "reward function" is based on minimizing the number of hours a vehicle is out of service during peak demand. This model learns the best dispatch actions over time. |
| **Consequences** |
- **Pros (Justification):**
    - **Optimal Efficiency:** RL is superior for sequential decision-making in dynamic environments, leading to the best possible utilization of staff and fleet
    - **Adaptability:** Automatically adapts to changes in traffic patterns or new parking spot layouts.
- **Cons (Trade-offs):** Higher initial development complexity and data requirements; "Exploration" phase of RL could lead to sub-optimal decisions in early deployment; difficult to audit and explain the "why" behind a decision (low explainability).
